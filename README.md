# machine-learning-app-for-education
The objective of this Metis Data Science Bootcamp Project was to apply Machine Learning (ML) to build a Proof of Concept App to enrich studentsâ€™ educational development. These objectives were defined into functional blocks and the appropriate machine learning models then developed in phases, spanning project-four and project-five.
